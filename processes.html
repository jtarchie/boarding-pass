    <h2 class="section-header"><a name="ipms"></a><span class="section-number">5.1 </span>IPMs</h2>

<p>An IPM, or Iteration Planning Meeting, is meeting held every Monday by each <a href="teams.html">team</a> or <a href="tracks.html">track</a>.</p><p>The outcome of an IPM is to have a clear idea of what your team will be working on for that week, in the form of GitHub issues and projects. This is typically done through the <a href="https://project.concourse-ci.org/projects">Cadet Projects page</a> but may also be done directly on GitHub.</p><p>To build a consensus on the difficulty of each task ahead, engineers on the team will typically assign each of the issues with one of the following labels:</p><dl>
  
  <dt><code>size/small</code></dt>
    <dd><p>Low effort required with well-defined scope.</p></dd>
  
  <dt><code>size/medium</code></dt>
    <dd><p>An easily manageable amount of work. Well-defined scope, few unknowns.</p></dd>
  
  <dt><code>size/large</code></dt>
    <dd><p>A ton of work, possibly in multiple places. Mostly understood, but there may be unknown unknowns.</p></dd>
  
  <dt><code>size/x-large</code></dt>
    <dd><p>This needs to be split up and/or mapped out more clearly before we can begin.</p></dd>
  
</dl><p>IPMs are also a great time to bring up GitHub issues or pull requests that you&#39;ve noticed or submitted yourself in order to discuss them with the team and prioritize them.</p>


  

  
    <h2 class="section-header"><a name="retros"></a><span class="section-number">5.2 </span>Retros</h2>

<p>A retro is held every Friday by each <a href="teams.html">team</a> or <a href="tracks.html">track</a>. Currently we alternate team-wide retros and track-only retros (a.k.a. &#34;small-team&#34; retros) on a weekly basis, though we overrule the schedule fairly often.</p><p>The outcome of a retro is camaraderie and surfacing of pain felt through the past iteration or few iterations to lead to action items to tackle in the coming iterations.</p><p>Weekly retros are open-ended, and can touch on technical issues, processes, or just general airing of grievances. More targeted retros (i.e. tech retros, process retros) are usually scheduled ad-hoc. Feel free to suggest them within your team!</p>


  

  
    <h2 class="section-header"><a name="pairing"></a><span class="section-number">5.3 </span>Pairing</h2>

<p>Pairing is an implied part of our process, though it is not enforced. Everything is submitted through pull requests, so pairing is not technically necessary for code review, but it is still recommended for...you know, all the other benefits to pairing.</p>


  
    <h3 class="section-header"><a name="soloing"></a><span class="section-number">5.3.1 </span>Soloing</h3>

<p>That being said, some times soloing is the right thing to do. If you&#39;re working on something that&#39;s frankly pretty boring to pair on, feel free to solo while being conscious of things you may want to consult with the team about; prefer over-communication to no communication. If during your onboarding you would prefer to just take your time and figure things out on your own for a bit, that can work too.</p>


  

  
    <h3 class="section-header"><a name="pair-rotation"></a><span class="section-number">5.3.2 </span>Pair Rotation</h3>

<p>Pair rotation within your <a href="tracks.html">track</a> or <a href="teams.html">team</a> is encouraged, but rotation frequency is undefined. Some enjoy more rapid rotation. Some would rather stick on their story for a while so they can continue learning.</p><p>Rotation frequency is a frequent topic for retros. The general recommendation is to just consider it every morning. If you can rotate, prefer to rotate, but if that would be particularly anxiety-inducing, don&#39;t worry about it.</p>


  

  

  
    <h2 class="section-header"><a name="tracks-process"></a><span class="section-number">5.4 </span>Tracks</h2>

<p>&#34;Tracks&#34; is our attempt to mitigate the context whiplash involved in rotating through too many different parts of Concourse too frequently. For a list and description of the tracks, see <a href="tracks.html">Tracks</a>.</p><p>Tracks effectively behave as teams within the team. Each track has its own <a href="processes.html#ipms">IPM</a> with its own backlog, and a <a href="processes.html#retros">retro</a> for each track is scheduled every other week (alternating with a &#34;big retro&#34; across all teams).</p><p>Tracks are not meant to be enforced barriers within the team. They are meant to be guide rails to help individual team members who would rather spend most of their time in one context. If you are every curious about what another track is doing, feel free to attend their meetings as well.</p>


  
    <h3 class="section-header"><a name="track-rotation"></a><span class="section-number">5.4.1 </span>Track Rotation</h3>

<p>Rotating between tracks is not an active process right now, but it&#39;s something we&#39;d like to explore.</p><p>An experiment we will likely try soon is to do epic-based pairing and rotation instead of track-based pairing. (More on this soon.)</p>


  

  

  
    <h2 class="section-header"><a name="reviewing-prs"></a><span class="section-number">5.5 </span>Reviewing PRs</h2>

<p>Pull requests are just as if not more important than anything in the backlog. It is imperative that we be responsive and kind to those who are trying to help us out. Remember: it&#39;s OK if you&#39;re not able to review something quickly, and over-communicating is never a bad thing.</p><p>For a more in depth overview on how to review pull requests, check out <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/How-to-Process-PRs">How to Process PRs</a> in our GitHub wiki.</p>


  

  
    <h2 class="section-header"><a name="rfcs"></a><span class="section-number">5.6 </span>RFCs</h2>

<p>Substantial proposals to the roadmap are almost always made through an RFC. The process is described in the <a href="https://github.com/concourse/rfcs#concourse-rfcs"><code>concourse/rfcs</code> repo</a>.</p>


  

  
    <h2 class="section-header"><a name="design-studios"></a><span class="section-number">5.7 </span>Design Studios</h2>

<p>(TODO. Ask <a href="https://github.com/matthewpereira">Matthew Periera</a>!)</p>
